# distance-between-polygons2
This version without server. Read from file and write result data to file. 

To run the app just start the command.bat file.
Then you will be asked to write the names of input and output files.
Keep in mind that they must be in the same directory as the app.

Answers:
1) If the distance was calculated from point to point, then u will be able to see the distance value and numbers of vertex which form this distance.
2) If the distance was calculated from point to side, then u will be able to get distance value, info about top and its polygon (first or second one) and info about tops which are formed the side.
3) If the polygons are crossed, then the distance is 0.

You can test the different arrays of vertexes by changing the positions of arrays in input.txt example file to get all these three cases. After each set of values you can find the result example.
